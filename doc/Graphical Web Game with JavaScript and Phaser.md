### Goals
- Know what JavaScript and Phaser are
- Understand and be able to modify some simple Phaser programs
- Be able to create a small game of your own design

### Introduction
#### [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
#### [Phaser](http://phaser.io)

### Activities
#### Walk through and modify some simple Phaser programs
##### Using repl.it
- [Hello, World](https://repl.it/@dcbriccetti/hello)
    - Change the greeting
    - Change the text size and color
    - Change the background color
- [Hello, World with a Sprite](https://repl.it/@dcbriccetti/hello-sprite)
    - Make the sprite rotate faster
    - Reverse the rotation direction
- [Moving Character](https://repl.it/@dcbriccetti/moving-character)
    - Make the character move in all four directions
    - Change the movement speed
    - Experiment with different drag values
- [Bounce](https://repl.it/@dcbriccetti/bounce)
    - Experiment with different values for gravity, drag and bounce
    - Replace the graphic with one that you draw or find, considering appropriate use
      - Consider using [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/)
- [Multi-Bounce](https://repl.it/@dcbriccetti/multi-bounce)
    - Change the ball-generation rate
    - Change the ball spawn position
    - Change the range of random X axis velocities
    - Change the fade-out time (look for “alpha”)
    - Change the number of balls that can exist
    - Change the way the balls spin (angular velocity)
    - Have the ball sizes be random
- [Platform](https://repl.it/@dcbriccetti/platform)
    - Change how high the character jumps
    - Add another platform
    - Let the character leave the screen
    - Allow jumping even when the character is not on a surface
